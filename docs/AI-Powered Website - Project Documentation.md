# AI-Powered Website - Project Documentation

## üéØ Project Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive AI-powered website that tracks user information and uses artificial intelligence to predict what brings users to the site. The application demonstrates advanced user behavior analytics, real-time AI predictions, and full GDPR compliance.

## üåê Live Website

**Production URL**: https://g8h3ilc77g08.manus.space

The website is fully deployed and operational. You can access it immediately to see all features in action.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time User Tracking**
- **Session Management**: Automatic session creation with unique IDs
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Click tracking, scroll depth monitoring, time on page
- **Device Detection**: Automatic device type identification (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- **Event Stream**: Live feed of user interactions with timestamps

### 2. **AI-Powered Intent Prediction**
- **Primary Intent Detection**: AI predicts main user intent (Information, Research, Purchase, Learning, etc.)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Percentage confidence for each prediction
- **Secondary Intents**: Alternative predictions with confidence scores
- **Prediction Factors**: Human-readable explanations of what influenced the AI decision
- **8 Intent Categories**: Information, Research, Purchase, Learning, Entertainment, Navigation, Support, Comparison

### 3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Active users, events per second, prediction accuracy, data points
- **User Journey Analytics**: Comprehensive behavior analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: AI model accuracy, precision, and recall statistics
- **Visual Charts**: Progress bars and interactive data visualization

### 4. **Privacy & GDPR Compliance**
- **Consent Management**: Granular control over tracking preferences
- **Data Rights**: View, update, export, and delete personal data
- **GDPR Compliant**: Full compliance with EU privacy regulations
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear information about data usage

### 5. **Professional Interface**
- **Modern Design**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for all device types
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live data updates every 5 seconds
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Tabbed interface for easy access to all features

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **UI Components**: Professional component library with icons
- **State Management**: React hooks for real-time state updates
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch support

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **API**: RESTful API with CORS support
- **AI Engine**: Custom intent prediction algorithms
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with unique IDs

### AI/ML Engine
- **Algorithm**: Rule-based machine learning with statistical analysis
- **Features**: Time patterns, interaction levels, scroll behavior, device context
- **Prediction Models**: 8 distinct intent categories with confidence scoring
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant predictions based on user behavior

### Database Schema
- **UserSession**: Session data, device info, timestamps
- **UserEvent**: Individual user interactions (clicks, scrolls, page views)
- **IntentPrediction**: AI predictions with confidence scores
- **ConsentRecord**: Privacy consent preferences

## üìä How the AI Works

The AI intent prediction engine analyzes multiple factors:

1. **Time Patterns**: Session duration and timing behavior
2. **Interaction Level**: Click frequency and engagement depth
3. **Content Engagement**: Scroll depth and reading patterns
4. **Device Context**: Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
5. **Referrer Analysis**: Traffic source influence

The system combines these factors using weighted algorithms to predict user intent with confidence scores ranging from 0-100%.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### For Website Visitors:
1. Visit https://g8h3ilc77g08.manus.space
2. The system automatically starts tracking (with consent)
3. Interact with the page to see real-time analytics
4. View AI predictions in the "Intent Prediction" tab
5. Manage privacy settings in the "Privacy" tab

### For Administrators:
- All data is stored in the backend database
- Analytics are available through the dashboard
- Privacy compliance is automatically handled
- Session data can be exported or deleted per GDPR requirements

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **GDPR Compliant**: Full compliance with EU privacy regulations
- **Consent-Based**: Users control their tracking preferences
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can delete their data at any time
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear information about data usage
- **Secure Storage**: All data is securely stored and processed

## üìÅ Project Files

The complete project includes:

1. **Frontend Source Code**: `/ai-intent-tracker/` - React application
2. **Backend Source Code**: `/ai_intent_backend/` - Flask API and AI engine
3. **Documentation**: Research findings, system architecture, and technical specifications
4. **Deployment**: Production-ready deployment on Manus platform

## üéâ Demonstration
