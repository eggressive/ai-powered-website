## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or pnpm

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd ai_intent_backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ai-intent-tracker
npm install  # or pnpm install
npm run dev  # or pnpm dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create appropriate environment files for your setup. The application uses SQLite by default for development.

## 📊 How the AI Works

The AI intent prediction engine analyzes multiple factors:

1. **Time Patterns**: Session duration and timing behavior
2. **Interaction Level**: Click frequency and engagement depth
3. **Content Engagement**: Scroll depth and reading patterns
4. **Device Context**: Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
5. **Referrer Analysis**: Traffic source influence

The system combines these factors using weighted algorithms to predict user intent with confidence scores.
